# Introduction

This is a final project for my Project-Based Intern as a Big Data Analytics at PT. Kimia Farma, Tbk (provided by Rakamin Academy). As a Big Data Analyst Intern who understands the sales data for each Brand at Kimia Farma, I was assigned to create a dashboard for sales report in one year from the raw data that has been provided.  

# Tools
- PostgreSQL
- Google Data Studio

# Process
- Clean the raw data and create a datamart using PostgreSQL
- Create an aggregated dataset to make analysis process easier
- Create a dashboard based on the datamart

# Result
The dashboard was created by Google Data Studio [here](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/461e90ed-4ef9-4644-8f1b-d86a3e9c5805) and this is the screen capture for the dashboard:

From the dashboard, we can see the sales growth for the past year based on
-the brand of the product,
-the product itself,
-the city where all the products are being sold,
-the date of the transactions.
